            <p>Chess Academy was created with a bold spirit and a mighty objective: to offer the best online chess learning software at a low price, in order to make chess accessible to as many people as possible.<br>Today, many people - from parents and teachers to neuroscientists - are aware of the benefits of chess. Janton van Apeldoorn, who started Chessity in 2011, experienced this first-hand. As a boy, he was struggling hard at school. Chess threw him a lifeline and helped him overcome his problems. With Chess Academy, he set out on a personal mission to do the same for others.<br><em>Chess is a gift to the brain.</em><br>Chess Academy is about enabling people throughout the world to experience the benefits of chess.</p>
